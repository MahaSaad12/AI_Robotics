# 🎯 Multi-Sensor 3D View Planning & Calibration Toolkit

This repository contains a modular Python-based system for simulating and evaluating multi-camera calibration using a 3D calibration object (icosahedron) and multiple sensor viewpoints. Developed as part of a Master’s thesis at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The project enables sensor visibility analysis, 3D visualization, and pose estimation using a structured and modular Python implementation. It evaluates how well sensors can detect different faces of a calibration object based on angles, distance, and orientation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib PyQt5
```

### ▶️ Running the 3D Viewer

Navigate to the visualization folder or the main GUI file and run:

```bash
python orientation.py
```

This will launch a dynamic 3D window showing sensor positions, visibility status, and live updates as the object rotates.

### 📏 Accuracy Evaluation

To evaluate how accurately sensors detect the correct faces:

```bash
python accuracy_@.py
```

Ensure the file `sensor_distance.csv` is available in the same directory or update the path accordingly.

## 📉 Sample Output

```
Sensor 1:
  ✅ Detected Face Indices : [0, 1, 3]
  🎯 Expected Faces         : [0, 1, 5]
  🎯 Correct Matches        : [0, 1]
  📈 Accuracy Score         : 0.67
  📏 Avg Distance           : 5.66
```

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **Sensor Visibility**: Determines how many icosahedron faces each sensor can see.
- **GOOD/BAD Classification**: A sensor is labeled GOOD if it detects 5 or more faces.
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of sensor frustums and face orientations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy based on match between detected and expected faces.

## ❗ Troubleshooting

- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure CSV files like `Camera_calibration_object_poses.csv` are in the correct directory (e.g., `Calibration_object_data/`).
- **GUI Not Launching**: Ensure PyQt5 is installed and you're running with a GUI-capable environment.
